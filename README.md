# Pong

## Introduction
Hello random person (hopefully a recruiter interested in hiring me), welcome to my Pong github repo. My goal here is to do a couple of things:
<ol>
  <li> Teach myself some markdown <strong>done</strong> </li>
  <li> Implement the game of pong in pygame <strong>done</strong> </li>
  <li> Hardcode some simple agents to play pong 
    <ol> 
      <li> Stupid (doesn't move paddle) </li>
      <li> Random </li>
      <li> Greedy (tries to keep the paddle level with ball at all times) </li>
    </ol>
  <li> Create and train a variety of intelligent agents to play pong </li>
  <ol> 
      <li> Q-learning with a neural net </li>
      <ol>
        <li> Trained with Reinforcement Learning </li>
        <li> Trained with a genetic algorithm </li>
      </ol>
      <li> Actor Critic with Q-learning </li>
      <li> More that I heaven't thought of yet </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

Then, I want to have the <strong>WWE SMACKDOWN</strong> of pong agents, where each of the above are pitted against each other in a single elimination tournament.
